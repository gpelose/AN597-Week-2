# Copying and Pasting RAW data into atom and also installed stringr to this R project.

#Creating a vecotr of one word characters from the first line of the book Ulysses.

v<-c("Stately", "plump", "buck", "Mulligan", "came", "from", "the", "stairhead,", "bearing", "a", "bowl", "of", "lather", "on", "which", "a", "mirror", "and", "a", "razor", "lay", "crossed.")

#Now I want to extract every third element of this vector 

str_extract(v, "buck")
str_extract(v, "from")
str_extract(v, "bearing")
str_extract(v, "of")
str_extract(v, "which")
str_extract(v, "and")
str_extract(v, "lay")

#Creating Matrix 

m <- matrix(data=1:80,nrow=8,ncol=10,byrow=FALSE)

# naming rows and columns of matrix (m)

rownames(m) <-c("r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5", "r6", "r7", "r8")
colnames(m) <-c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4", "c5", "c6", "c7", "c8", "c9", "c10")

#I just found out that I did not want to name them so starting back to creating the matrix.

m <- matrix(data=1:80,nrow=8,ncol=10,byrow=FALSE)


#selecting specific column and rows and assigning them to a variable. First I will name the 2nd 3rd and 6th column, c2, c3, and c6 

c2 <- m[,2]
c3 <- m[,3]
c6 <- m[,6]

#Now I will attempt to put all of these under the variable x
#this did not work, I will now try and make a new matrix using the assingned names. 

m[c(c2, c3, c6)]

#Now I will assign them to the variable x

x <- m[c(c2, c3, c6)]

#now I will extract the 6th to 8th row by naming each row r6, r7 and r8, creating a new matrix with these variables, followed by assigning them to the variable x

r6 <- m[6,]
r7 <- m[7,]
r8 <- m[8,]

x <- m[c(r6, r7, r8)]

I will now do the same thing for part three of 











```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
