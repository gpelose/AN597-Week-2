# Copying and Pasting RAW data into atom and also installed stringr to this R project.

#Creating Matrix 

m <- matrix(data=1:80,nrow=8,ncol=10,byrow=FALSE)

# naming rows and columns of matrix (m)

rownames(m) <-c("r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5", "r6", "r7", "r8")
colnames(m) <-c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4", "c5", "c6", "c7", "c8", "c9", "c10")

#I just found out that I did not want to name them so starting back to creating the matrix.

m <- matrix(data=1:80,nrow=8,ncol=10,byrow=FALSE)


#selecting specific column and rows and assigning them to a variable. First I will name the 2nd 3rd and 6th column, c2, c3, and c6 

c2 <- m[,2]
c3 <- m[,3]
c6 <- m[,6]

#Now I will attempt to put all of these under the variable x
#this did not work, I will now try and make a new matrix using the assingned names. 

m[c(c2, c3, c6)]

#Now I will assign them to the variable x

x <- m[c(c2, c3, c6)]

#now I will extract the 6th to 8th row by naming each row r6, r7 and r8, creating a new matrix with these variables, followed by assigning them to the variable x

r6 <- m[6,]
r7 <- m[7,]
r8 <- m[8,]

x <- m[c(r6, r7, r8)]

#I will now do the same thing for part three of challenge 2 where I will extract the elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9 and assign them to the variable x

c9 <- m[,9]
r2 <- m[2,]

#I already have row 6 and column 2 assigned. I added c9 and r2

x <- m[c(r2, c2, r6, c9)]

#Challenge 3 
# I am going to Construct a 4-dimensional, 400 element array (5 x 5 x 4 x 4) named a consisting of the numbers 400 to 1 (i.e., a descending series).

a <- array(data=1:400,dim=c(5,5,4,4))

#Next step of the challenge: Given this matrix, what would the following return?

a[1, 1, 1, 2]

#this returned with a value of 101

a[2, 3, 2, ]

#This returned with these values 37 137 237 337

a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]

#Below is what was returned when thee values were plugged in.

[2,]  252  257  262  267  272

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
